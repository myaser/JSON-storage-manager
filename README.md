# JSON-storage-manager

## problem deffination:

The JSON storage manager should act as an application core that is unique. The JSON storage manager package may use other packages internally to facilitate working with JSON files.

considerations:
* Concurrency control
* Efficiency (Memory concern)
* what to do if the JSON does not fit in memory
